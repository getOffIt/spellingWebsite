# Rough Idea: Skip Button for Spelling Test

## Initial Concept

Add a skip button to the spelling test so if Leo really doesn't know how to spell a word, he does not get stuck. Stats should count a skip as a failed attempt.

## Context

This feature is for the Spelling Website application, which helps children practice spelling through interactive tests with text-to-speech functionality and progress tracking.
